Case Study: How can a wellness company play it smart?

The following case study is from the Google Data Analytics Course. In this study, I will be performing tasks and asking key business questions similar to those of a junior data analyst. 

The case is for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and I will be using a dataset from Kaggle.
