#The Bellabeat case study is from the Google Data Analytics Course. 
In this case study, I will demonstrate how I can use SQL to help answer a key business question for the company I work for.

#The question asked by the company: What are some trends in smart device usage?

Here are the SQL codes I wrote that could be helpful in answering this question:

--Finding the average amount of minutes reported for each type of activity

SELECT avg(SedentaryMinutes) AS Average_Sedentary_Minutes, 
avg(LightlyActiveMinutes) AS Average_Lightly_Active_Minutes,
avg(FairlyActiveMinutes) AS Average_Fairly_Active_Minutes,
avg(VeryActiveMinutes) AS Average_Very_Active_Minutes
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_intensities`;

--Seeing how daily steps compare to daily caloric intake

SELECT PersonID, StepTotal, Calories
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_calories` cals
INNER JOIN `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_Steps` Steps
ON cals.PersonID = Steps.Person_id;


--Finding the total amount of steps reported per individual

SELECT Person_id, 
SUM(StepTotal) AS Total_Steps 
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_Steps`
Group By Person_id;


--Finding the sum of all the time spent on every type of activity and comparing it to the calorie intake of each individual

SELECT Id, sum(VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryMinutes) AS Total_Minutes_Of_Activity,Calories 
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_activity`
GROUP BY Id,
VeryActiveMinutes, 
FairlyActiveMinutes, 
LightlyActiveMinutes, 
SedentaryMinutes,
Calories;
