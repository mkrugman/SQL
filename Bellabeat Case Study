The following case study is from the Google Data Analytics Course. In this study, I will be performing tasks and asking key business questions similar to those of a junior data analyst. 

Questions to answer:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

SQL codes I wrote for this question:

SELECT avg(SedentaryMinutes) 
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_intensities`

--Average minutes of sedentary activity is ~991 minutes

SELECT avg(SedentaryMinutes) 
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_intensities`







2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
