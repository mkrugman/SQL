The Bellabeat case study is from the Google Data Analytics Course. In this study, I will be using SQL to help answer key business questions 

Key questions asked by the company in this study:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

SQL codes I wrote that could be helpful in answering this question:

--Finding the average amount of minutes reported for each type of activity

SELECT avg(SedentaryMinutes) AS Average_Sedentary_Minutes, 
avg(LightlyActiveMinutes) AS Average_Lightly_Active_Minutes,
avg(FairlyActiveMinutes) AS Average_Fairly_Active_Minutes,
avg(VeryActiveMinutes) AS Average_Very_Active_Minutes
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_intensities`;

--Finding the total amount of minutes reported for each activity and grouping each time by individual



--Finding the sum of all the time spent on every type of activity and comparing it to the calorie intake of each individual

SELECT Id, sum(VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryMinutes) AS Total_Minutes_Of_Activity,Calories 
FROM `bellabeat-case-study-397404.FitBase_Data.Daily_activity`
GROUP BY Id,
VeryActiveMinutes, 
FairlyActiveMinutes, 
LightlyActiveMinutes, 
SedentaryMinutes,
Calories;















2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
